        *CyberArena (game)*

        Your goal is to destroy the enemy using weapons.
        The main difficulty is that each of the 5 available weapons can only win 2 others. These core mechanics somewhat remind a famous **"Rock, paper, scissors"** game. You will have to think through every step because even a small accident can change the course of the game.
        Each weapon has a chance to trigger its unique perk that can help in the battle.

        🩸 *Atomic Annihilation* - double damage 🩸
        💨 *Electric Katana* - evasion 💨
        💉 *Neurochip Hack* - lifesteal 💉
        🔥 *Plasma Grenade* - +30% damage (damage spread increased) 🔥
        ⚡️ *Laser Pistol* - Counterattack (Retaliation) ⚡️
      battles: |
        *⚔️ Duels*

        CyberArena hosts duels with other players.
        You can fight either in free or TON-betted battles.

        Participation in battles provides you with *Experience 🧬*, which can be converted into in-game currency named *Praxis 💾*

        🧬 *Experience gain*
        During your first 10 training battles, every victory will bring you *+100%* additional experience, while every loss will provide *+25%*.
        After *100 free fights*, the experience gained will begin to decrease. These mechanics will protect PunkCity from bots and maintain the *Praxis 💾* emission stability.

        *💎 TON-betted fights*
        Fights with TON bets will help you earn more experience.
        The experience gained depends on the bet. When creating a paid match, you will see an approximate coefficient in the menu. The experience coefficient is flexible and varies on many factors.
        Losing betted games provides *50%* experience. In TON-betted matches, there is no experience reduction.
      black_market: |
        *Black market*

        🌃 *"Black Market"* is a *PunkCity* store where you choose a product and pay with *Praxis 💾*

        *📦 The offers are rotating:*
        Both art collectors and casual community members can find something interesting there.
        If you think collecting isn't your passion, you can make money by reselling items.

        Sometimes the black market feature offers from our friends, such as early NFT sales or Starter Packs for P2E games powered by the TON blockchain.
      praxis_bank: |
        *Praxis Bank*

        💾 *Praxis*
        The experience gained in duels can be converted into *Praxis.*
        Praxis is used for purchases on the *"Black Market".*
        If you don't have enough time to earn *Praxis* 💾 through duels, you can purchase it in the bank for TON💎

        *📚 Praxis Exchange 💾*
        The exchange rate is *1000 experience* 🧬 = *100 Praxis* 💾
        Each new conversion takes 1 hour more than the previous one.
        The premium exchange feature lets you quickly convert experience into Praxis at a better rate of *1000🧬 = 150💾* (instead of 100). Premium exchange requires you to pay a commission in TON. To do this, you need to pay a commission in TON.

        _The level of your *TON Punks NFT* will not change by converting free experience._
      profile: |
        *PunkCity Profile*

        *🧬 Experience and level 🔰*
        At the end of every battle, you earn experience that increases your Prestige level.
        (it accumulates your lifetime experience and associates it with TON Punks NFT.)
        Your Prestige level determines your ability to participate in airdrops. 🎁

        You are encouraged to tether your TON Punks NFT to your PunkCity profile.

        *🔗 Tethering TON Punks NFT to PunkCity.*
        Tethering an NFT will provide you with a *+10% bonus* experience earned in any match.
        You will also receive a daily reward in *Praxis 💾* and *Experience 🧬*
        The size of this reward increases every third day, starting from *5💾* and ending with *30💾* per day
        Each additional Punk on your wallet will bring another *5💾* and *300🧬* daily.

        If you decide to sell your tethered *NFT*, you will also sell its stats and Prestige level.
        If you've just purchased and tethered your new *TON Punks NFT*, your accumulated experience will be *transferred* onto it.
